# JMeter Demo

## Intro

This repo is intended to help you get started your Jmeter Testing for Oracle APEX. It provides 3 services:
 - [a Starter Template](jmeter/jmx/Starter%20Template.jmx) to start your test with some helpful configuration
 - [a JSR223 scraping script](jmeter/js/jsr223.js) to extract the necessary security parameters you'll need to execute POST requests
 - an originizing framework based on the [Insum Starter Template](https://github.com/insum-labs/starter-project-template)


## Next Step

You'll want to start in the [jmeter folder](jmeter/README.md) to install the JMeter binaries
